<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CopyDetect is to compute several IRT and non-IRT based
response similarity indices proposed in the literature for
multiple-choice examinations such as the Omega index
[(Wollack, 1997)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/01466216970214002),Generalized
Binomial Test [(van der Linden &
Sotaridona, 2006)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/10769986031003283),K
index, K1 and K2 indices [(Sotaridona &
Meijer, 2002)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-3984.2002.tb01138.x),
M4 index [(Maynes,2014)](), and S1 and S2 indices [(Sotaridona &
Meijer, 2003)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-3984.2003.tb01096.x).
